# Todo App

This project is a simple Todo List application that allows users to manage their daily tasks. Users can add, delete, and mark tasks as complete, as well as filter them based on their status (active, completed, or all tasks). The application stores the user's tasks in the browser's localStorage for persistence.

## Features

- **Add new tasks:** Users can enter a task and add it to their list.
- **Mark tasks as complete:** Tasks can be marked as completed by clicking on them.
- **Delete tasks:** Users can delete tasks from the list.
- **Filter tasks:** Filter tasks by their completion status
- **Toggle all tasks:** Mark all tasks as completed or active with a single checkbox.
- **Clear completed tasks:** Users can remove all completed tasks from the list.

## Tools and Technologies

- **React**: For building the user interface and managing application state.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **Vercel**: A modern build tool that provides a faster development experience.
- **localStorage:** For persisting tasks across page reloads.
